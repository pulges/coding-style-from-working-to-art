# Javascript: from working to art

The quality of a coder, from managers perspective, is often measured in hours, but You should not let yourself be
confused by this blinding fact and try to finish the job at hand as fast as possible. The quality of code, from the
perspective of other coders is measured in WTF-s per hour. All coders agree that a code with less WTFs/h is not only
easier to read, but also faster to work on. Almost always more hours are spent on fixing and improving existing features,
than creating new ones. So writing code that is well documented, readable and manageable, improves the speed of the
whole collective and thus the time spent at first, will be rewarded soon. Not to mention it will give You higher
reputation and improve Your social status among co-workers (without without the need to actually speak too much - perfect
for introverts).

This here is an opinionated collection of tips and tricks to make Your life better by making life easier to whoever
needs to read or fix your code in the future. Keep in mind that the fixer might be the future You, and it is often the
highest praise of all to be impressed by Your own code from years back. The examples here are mostly javascript
React-Redux-Saga application based but the ideas can probably be easily carried over to other environments as well.
